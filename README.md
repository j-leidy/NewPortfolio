# Portfolio

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
This portfolio was a complete overhaul of my previous portfolio. The previous portfolio implemented poor design choices and was not easily expandable. I decided to recreate the portfolio in TypeScript alongside the redesign process. This lead to a portfolio that is easy to expand with a strong fundamental base.
